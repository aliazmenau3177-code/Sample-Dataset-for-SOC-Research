# Sample-Dataset-for-SOC-Research
A sample dataset which is desirable for enhancing research efforts in SOC/ SIEM with respect to efficent detection of false positives. The dataset is being uploaded for all research community so that SIEM research can be supported and improvements within the same can be solicited. 
This is a sample dataset which signifies the desirable features or attributes that shall be present within a SOC/ SIEM research dataset so that researchers can develop effective algorithms to detect attacks and eliminate false postivies. 
This dataset is linked to my research on SOC datasets and I have made it open for the research community. Any suggestion or improvement is more than welcome.
